The package contains 2 files:
1. main.m
2. turbofanEqn.m

To run the program, run main.m script in MATLAB command window.
>> main

The program will take a few seconds to calculate the results.

Results:
On the main command window, Design Engine Parameters, Resultant Values,
and Calculated Parameters are listed. 5 Figures are also generated:
1. Figure 1 displays resultant bypass ratio for various compression ratios.
2. Figure 2 displays TSFC for various compression ratios.
3. Figure 3 displays Cost function value for various compression ratios.
4. Figure 4 displays f value for various compression ratios.
5. Figure 5 displays T_03 value for various compression ratios.
